      description: "An overview of the essential web development skills I've acquired and honed while working on various projects, from React hooks to API integration.",
      category: "Web Development",
      date: "2024-03-20",
      content: "Throughout my journey as a web developer, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have significantly enhanced my skill set. In this post, I'll share some of the key skills I've gained and how they've been applied in real-world scenarios.\n\n## 1. Mastering React Hooks\n\nOne of the most transformative skills I've developed is proficiency with React Hooks. Through projects like my portfolio website and various client applications, I've learned to leverage hooks to create more efficient and readable code.\n\n### Example: Custom useLocalStorage Hook\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {\n  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {\n    try {\n      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);\n      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.log(error);\n      return initialValue;\n    }\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(storedValue));\n  }, [key, storedValue]);\n\n  return [storedValue, setStoredValue];\n}\n```\n\nThis custom hook has been invaluable in managing local storage across my applications, providing a clean and reusable solution for persisting data.\n\n## 2. Next.js and Server-Side Rendering\n\nWorking with Next.js has dramatically improved my understanding of server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). These skills have been crucial in developing high-performance, SEO-friendly websites.\n\n### Example: Dynamic Routes with getStaticProps and getStaticPaths\n\n```javascript\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const paths = getAllPostIds();\n  return {\n    paths,\n    fallback: false\n  };\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const postData = await getPostData(params.id);\n  return {\n    props: {\n      postData\n    }\n  };\n}\n\nexport default function Post({ postData }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <Head>\n        <title>{postData.title}</title>\n      </Head>\n      <article>\n        <h1>{postData.title}</h1>\n        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: postData.contentHtml }} />\n      </article>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis pattern has been essential in creating dynamic, pre-rendered pages for blogs and e-commerce sites.\n\n## 3. API Integration and Data Fetching\n\nDeveloping full-stack applications has honed my skills in API integration and efficient data fetching. I've worked with RESTful APIs and GraphQL, implementing best practices for data management.\n\n### Example: Using SWR for Data Fetching\n\n```javascript\nimport useSWR from 'swr';\n\nconst fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then(res => res.json());\n\nfunction Profile() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher);\n\n  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>;\n  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n\n  return <div>Hello {data.name}!</div>;\n}\n```\n\nUsing SWR has greatly improved the user experience in my applications by providing real-time, cached data fetching.\n\n## 4. Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS\n\nAdopting Tailwind CSS has revolutionized my approach to creating responsive, customizable user interfaces. It's become an integral part of my development process, allowing for rapid prototyping and consistent design implementation.\n\n### Example: Responsive Navigation\n\n```html\n<nav className=\"flex items-center justify-between flex-wrap bg-teal-500 p-6\">\n  <div className=\"flex items-center flex-shrink-0 text-white mr-6\">\n    <span className=\"font-semibold text-xl tracking-tight\">My Portfolio</span>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"block lg:hidden\">\n    <button className=\"flex items-center px-3 py-2 border rounded text-teal-200 border-teal-400 hover:text-white hover:border-white\">\n      <svg className=\"fill-current h-3 w-3\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><title>Menu</title><path d=\"M0 3h20v2H0V3zm0 6h20v2H0V9zm0 6h20v2H0v-2z\"/></svg>\n    </button>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"w-full block flex-grow lg:flex lg:items-center lg:w-auto\">\n    <div className=\"text-sm lg:flex-grow\">\n      <a href=\"#responsive-header\" className=\"block mt-4 lg:inline-block lg:mt-0 text-teal-200 hover:text-white mr-4\">\n        Home\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"#responsive-header\" className=\"block mt-4 lg:inline-block lg:mt-0 text-teal-200 hover:text-white mr-4\">\n        Projects\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"#responsive-header\" className=\"block mt-4 lg:inline-block lg:mt-0 text-teal-200 hover:text-white\">\n        Contact\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</nav>\n```\n\nThis responsive navigation component adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, enhancing the overall user experience across devices.\n\n## 5. State Management with Redux Toolkit\n\nFor larger applications, I've incorporated Redux Toolkit to manage complex state logic. This has improved the scalability and maintainability of my projects.\n\n### Example: Creating a Redux Slice\n\n```javascript\nimport { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';\n\nexport const counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0,\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    increment: (state) => {\n      state.value += 1;\n    },\n    decrement: (state) => {\n      state.value -= 1;\n    },\n    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {\n      state.value += action.payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nexport const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;\n\nexport default counterSlice.reducer;\n```\n\nThis Redux Toolkit slice simplifies state management, making it easier to handle complex data flows in larger applications.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese skills represent just a fraction of what I've learned through my projects. Each new challenge has provided an opportunity to expand my knowledge and improve my craft. As I continue to grow as a developer, I look forward to tackling new technologies and solving increasingly complex problems in the world of web development."

      date: "2023-06-15",
      content: "React Hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. This means you can use React without classes. The most commonly used hooks are useState and useEffect.\n\nThe useState hook allows you to add state to functional components. Here's a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n```\n\nThe useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.\n\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n});\n```\n\nBy using these hooks, you can write more concise and easier-to-understand React code, leading to more maintainable applications."

        date: "2023-07-05",
        content: "In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of building a REST API comment section for your portfolio website using Next.js and MongoDB. This powerful combination allows for a seamless integration of backend and frontend, creating a dynamic and interactive comment system for your portfolio projects or blog posts.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a REST API is:\n\nREST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP. REST APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and easy to maintain. They use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, which are typically represented as URLs.\n\nNow, let's dive into building our comment section:\n\n1. Set up your Next.js project (if you haven't already):\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest my-portfolio --typescript\ncd my-portfolio\n```\n\n2. Install necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mongodb date-fns @types/mongodb\n```\n\n3. Set up MongoDB:\n- Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a new cluster.\n- Add your MongoDB connection string to a .env.local file in your project root:\n\n```\nMONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here\n```\n\n4. Create a database connection file (lib/mongodb.ts):\n\n```typescript\nimport { MongoClient } from 'mongodb'\n\nif (!process.env.MONGODB_URI) {\n  throw new Error('Invalid/Missing environment variable: \"MONGODB_URI\"')\n}\n\nconst uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI\nconst options = {}\n\nlet client\nlet clientPromise: Promise<MongoClient>\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {\n  if (!global._mongoClientPromise) {\n    client = new MongoClient(uri, options)\n    global._mongoClientPromise = client.connect()\n  }\n  clientPromise = global._mongoClientPromise\n} else {\n  client = new MongoClient(uri, options)\n  clientPromise = client.connect()\n}\n\nexport default clientPromise\n```\n\n5. Create API routes for handling comments. In your project, create a new file: app/api/projects/[projectId]/comments/route.ts:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport clientPromise from '@/lib/mongodb'\nimport { ObjectId } from 'mongodb'\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request, { params }: { params: { projectId: string } }) {\n  const { projectId } = params\n  const client = await clientPromise\n  const db = client.db(\"portfolio\")\n  const comments = await db.collection('comments').find({ projectId }).sort({ createdAt: -1 }).toArray()\n  return NextResponse.json(comments)\n}\n\nexport async function POST(request: Request, { params }: { params: { projectId: string } }) {\n  const { projectId } = params\n  const { name, email, content } = await request.json()\n  const client = await clientPromise\n  const db = client.db(\"portfolio\")\n  const newComment = {\n    projectId,\n    name,\n    email,\n    content,\n    createdAt: new Date()\n  }\n  const result = await db.collection('comments').insertOne(newComment)\n  const insertedComment = {\n    ...newComment,\n    _id: result.insertedId.toString()\n  }\n  return NextResponse.json(insertedComment)\n}\n```\n\n6. Create a CommentSection component (components/CommentSection.tsx):\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'\n\ninterface Comment {\n  _id: string\n  name: string\n  content: string\n  createdAt: string\n}\n\ninterface CommentSectionProps {\n  projectId: string\n}\n\nexport function CommentSection({ projectId }: CommentSectionProps) {\n  const [comments, setComments] = useState<Comment[]>([])\n  const { register, handleSubmit, reset } = useForm()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchComments()\n  }, [projectId])\n\n  const fetchComments = async () => {\n    const response = await fetch(`/api/projects/${projectId}/comments`)\n    const data = await response.json()\n    setComments(data)\n  }\n\n  const onSubmit = async (data) => {\n    const response = await fetch(`/api/projects/${projectId}/comments`, {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify(data),\n    })\n\n    if (response.ok) {\n      reset()\n      fetchComments()\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"mt-8\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">Comments</h2>\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className=\"mb-8\">\n        <div className=\"mb-4\">\n          <label htmlFor=\"name\" className=\"block mb-2\">Name:</label>\n          <input\n            {...register('name', { required: true })}\n            id=\"name\"\n            className=\"w-full p-2 border rounded\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"mb-4\">\n          <label htmlFor=\"email\" className=\"block mb-2\">Email:</label>\n          <input\n            {...register('email', { required: true })}\n            id=\"email\"\n            type=\"email\"\n            className=\"w-full p-2 border rounded\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"mb-4\">\n          <label htmlFor=\"content\" className=\"block mb-2\">Comment:</label>\n          <textarea\n            {...register('content', { required: true })}\n            id=\"content\"\n            className=\"w-full p-2 border rounded\"\n            rows={4}\n          ></textarea>\n        </div>\n        <button type=\"submit\" className=\"bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded\">\n          Submit Comment\n        </button>\n      </form>\n      <div>\n        {comments.map((comment) => (\n          <div key={comment._id} className=\"mb-4 p-4 bg-gray-100 rounded\">\n            <p className=\"font-bold\">{comment.name}</p>\n            <p className=\"text-sm text-gray-500\">{new Date(comment.createdAt).toLocaleString()}</p>\n            <p className=\"mt-2\">{comment.content}</p>\n          </div>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n7. Integrate the CommentSection into your project page (app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx):\n\n```tsx\nimport { CommentSection } from '@/components/CommentSection'\n\nexport default function ProjectPage({ params }: { params: { projectId: string } }) {\n  const { projectId } = params\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Your project details here */}\n      <CommentSection projectId={projectId} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith these steps, you'll have a fully functional REST API comment section integrated into your portfolio website. This setup allows for real-time commenting, efficient data storage with MongoDB, and a sleek UI powered by Next.js and React.\n\nThe GET and POST routes we've created follow REST principles, using standard HTTP methods to interact with our comment resources. The CommentSection component provides a form for users to submit new comments and displays existing comments for each project.\n\nRemember to style your components to match your portfolio's design, and consider adding features like comment moderation or user authentication for a more robust system. Happy coding!"
